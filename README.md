sudo apt install python3-colcon-common-extensions
cd ~/risbot2_ws
colcon build
echo 'source ~/risbot2_ws/install/setup.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
### 3. Arduino Uno R3 setup
Code for Arduino Uno R3: /risbot2_ws/src/risbot2/risbot2_micro_controller/risbot2_arduino_uno.ino

## Launch

### 1. Bringup RISBOT2

Open a terminal and run following command:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot.launch.py
```

or:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot2.launch.py
```
### 2. SLAM RISBOT2

+ SLAM with a t265:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot.launch.py
# Open a new terminal and run following command:
ros2 launch risbot2_cartographer cartographer.launch.py
```

+ SLAM with 2 T265s:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot2.launch.py
# Open a new terminal and run following command:
ros2 launch risbot2_cartographer cartographer2.launch.py
```

+ Open a new terminal and run following command to controll RISBOT2:
```bash
ros2 run risbot2_teleop teleop_keyboard
```

### 3. Navigation RISBOT2

- Navigation with a t265:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot.launch.py
# Open a new terminal and run following command:
ros2 launch risbot2_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py map:=/path/to/map.yaml
```

- Navigation with 2 t265s:
```bash
ros2 launch risbot2_bringup robot2.launch.py
# Open a new terminal and run following command:
ros2 launch risbot2_navigation2 navigation2.launch.py map:=/path/to/map.yaml
```
